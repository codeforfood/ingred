   <h2>What <em>is</em> ingred?</h2>
   <p>ingred is a minimal RESTful deployment written in PHP that focuses on standards and scalability while still encouraging flexibility.</p>
   <p>Just forget about the idea of a "framework" for a minute. ingred is designed to be more of a foundation that you can use to build on. nothing special, really. At the moment there is a limited set of tools, but that's just where i'm at. </p>
   <p>ingred is just index.php, and a few modifications to your .htaccess file. The rest is up to you. There are plenty of frameworks out there that have the audacity to claim that they were designed to stay out of your way. Clearly, i have a different idea of what "out of the way" means, because each and every one of them seem to use all sorts of strange voodoo in their attempt to improve on the wheel. When you're ready to deploy a new resource with ingred, just add it to your assets folder. Otherwise, smaller services can be managed through a simple project class. a combination of both also works; if that's what you're into.</p>
   <p>At present i'm rawking the GNU Lesser General Public License in hopes that i don't scare everyone away. I'm not gonna hate if you don't wanna make your project GPL, also. i'm okay with just <em>having</em> the opportunity to say "this software is free".</p>
